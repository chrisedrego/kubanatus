# Labels

- Labels are key/value pairs that are assigned to Kubernetes Objects, objects are like pods, services etc.
- Labels are mostly helpfull when we want to group related objects in kubernetes together.
- Labels can be assigned at the time of creating the Kubernetes Objects/Resources, and can be edited at any point of time.

- Labels are not required to be unique for different objects, Many Objects can have the same lable which can be used.
