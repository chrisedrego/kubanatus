# Linux Namespaces

- Linux Namespace in simple terms creates a degree of isolation so for a process so that it can only the resources alloted to it.
- Degree of isolation which is involved helps to make sure that the changes that occur in one namespace doesnt cause any issue with the other namespace

- As we know that process that get created are hierachial starting from init, and then their are child processes which get created, In this case the Linux namespace PID will have parent process under which can have multiple child processes as well.
