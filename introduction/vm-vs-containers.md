# Battle between VM's VS Containers

- Containers are light weight, as compared to the VM's as we already know that Containers dont have the additional kernel for each 
container but rather they share the kernel from the same host machine on which they are running.

- In this case, we might have often get confused that on docker hub for that matter we see docker images with image name such 
as ubuntu, alpine, debian, centos, in this case these images are light weight images which contain (binaries/libraries) which
contain very light foot print and at the end use the base OS kernel. 

- Container thereby consume lesser hardware resources as compared to the VM.

- As a take a way, containers make running more software application/components as compared to that virtual machines.
